# From Static to Dynamic Vision
- Evolution of Computer Vision Tasks
    - **Image Classification**: "What is in this image?"
    - **Object Detection**: "Where are the objects and what are they?"
    - **Image Segmentation**: "Which pixels belong to which objects?"

- **Key Shift**: 
    - Understanding spatial relationships and multiple objects in complex scenes

---

# Object Detection Fundamentals
- Bounding Boxes
    - Rectangular regions defining object locations
    - Formats: (x, y, width, height) or (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    - Confidence scores for each detection

- Key Challenges
    - Multiple objects at different scales
    - Real-time processing requirements
    - Occlusion and varying viewpoints

---
# YOLO: You Only Look Once

- Revolution in Real-time Detection
    - **Single-stage architecture**: 
        - Divides image into grid
        - Predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously
        - Extremely fast inference speeds

    - **Advantages**:
        - Real-time performance (45-150 FPS)
        - Global context understanding
        - Simple pipeline

---
# Image Segmentation Types
- Three Levels of Granularity
    1. **Semantic Segmentation**: Pixel-level classification
    2. **Instance Segmentation**: Differentiates between object instances
    3. **Panoptic Segmentation**: Combines both approaches

- Ref
    - [Semantic vs Instance vs Panoptic](https://pyimagesearch.com/2022/06/29/semantic-vs-instance-vs-panoptic-segmentation/)

---
# U-Net Architecture
- Specialized for Segmentation
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**:
    - **Encoder**: Feature extraction (contracting path)
    - **Decoder**: Precise localization (expanding path)
    - **Skip Connections**: Preserves spatial information

- **Applications**: Medical imaging, satellite imagery, autonomous driving

# Hands-on: Real-time Object Detection
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

# Load pre-trained model
model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt')

# Webcam detection
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    results = model(frame)
    annotated_frame = results[0].plot()
    cv2.imshow('YOLO Detection', annotated_frame)
```

# Hands-on: Image Segmentation
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load segmentation model
model = YOLO('yolo11n-seg.pt')

# Perform segmentation
results = model('street_scene.jpg')
results[0].show()  # Display with masks
```
